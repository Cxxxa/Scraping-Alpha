Mr. Ritchie, please go ahead.</p><h1>Brian Ritchie</h1><p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. After the market today, Ohr released financial results and provided a business update for fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. If you did not yet receive the release, it is available on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website at www.ohrpharmaceutical.com. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available.</p><p>Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the information contained in the news release and on this conference call contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Words of expression reflecting optimism, satisfaction with current prospects as well as words such as believe, intend, expect, plan, anticipate and similar variations identify forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. Such forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance and the company\u2019s actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in detail in the company\u2019s 10-K, 10-Qs as well as additional filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release and the conference call and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or supply new information regarding the circumstances after the date of this release.</p><p>Participating in today\u2019s call from the company are Dr. Jason Slakter, CEO, Mr. Sam Backenroth, CFO; Dr. Avner Ingerman, Chief Clinical Officer.</p><p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Slakter. Please go ahead, Jason.</p><h1>Jason Slakter</h1><p>Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. 2016 overall has been a very productive year at Ohr and we have been very successful in advancing our lead development candidate, topical Squalamine for the treatment of wet AMD. We now have a comprehensive Phase 3 program underway being conducted under a special protocol assessment from the FDA. We have also made progress advancing our preclinical pipeline of sustained release drug candidate we are developing for ophthalmic indications.</p><p>As you know, we conducted a Phase 2 study with Squalamine enrolling treatment-na\u00efve wet AMD subjects with all lesion characteristics, sizes and a wide range of visual acuity, subject to receive topical Squalamine or placebo drops twice a day, along with a single Lucentis injection at baseline followed by PRN Lucentis injections for the nine months of the study. The data demonstrated a visual acuity benefit in favor of combination therapy in all measures of visual function. When looking at new therapeutic treatment paradigm like Squalamine combination therapy, it is important to keep in mind that wet AMD is a multi-factorial disease with a complex vascular biology. This results in the development of neovascular lesions that vary by location, growth pattern, degree of exudation and response to treatment. We classified these lesions by fluorescein angiography as classic-only, occult-only and mixed lesions. Occult-only lesions represent nearly half of the wet AMD cases seen today.</p>", "company": "Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc.", "exec": [["Brian Ritchie", "LifeSci Advisors", "Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc."], ["Jason Slakter", "Chief Executive Officer", "Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc."], ["Sam Backenroth", "Chief Financial Officer", "Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc."], ["Avner Ingerman", "Chief Clinical Officer", "Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Corey Davis", "H.C.

Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today\u2019s press release.</p><p>We finished the year with another record quarter of adjusted earnings, which were $0.17 share, or 34% higher than our prior year, exceeding the midpoint of guidance by $0.10 per share and leading to the highest full year earnings in our company's history.</p><p>We achieved full year 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.6 billion or $3.45 per share, that's $500 million, or 28% per share higher than last year and more than double 2013 earnings of $1.55.</p><p>More importantly, we achieved return on invested capital of 9% and doubled our 2013 return on invested capital of 4.5%. We are pleased to have delivered by our shareholders doubled earnings and doubled return on invested capital in just three short years.</p><p>Strong operational improvement contributed $0.55 per share to the bottom-line year-over-year, which when combined with $0.14 of accretion from our share repurchase program, enabled us to exceed the high end of our original December guidance range of $3.10 to $3.40 per share. And that's despite an $0.18 drag from fuel and currency, both moving against us.</p><p>The strong results are a credit to the commitment and to the passion of our 120,000 team members, which when coupled with the support from our valued travel agent partners enabled us to overcome the significant obstacles encountered this past year, including the rare occurrence of a simultaneous negative from fuel and currency.</p><p>A series of global geopolitical events in Turkey, Paris, and Brussels, as well as concerns around Zika and Brexit. It is through their collective efforts that we delivered records earnings in 2016 and are gaining momentum as we embark on 2017 with booking volumes and pricing both well ahead of the prior year.</p><p>It was reinforcing to see constant currency revenue yield growth this year of roughly 4% inclusive of the previously disclosed 1% accounting change on top of the over 4% improvement achieved last year.</p><p>We enjoyed ticket price improvements for both our North American and our EAA brands, with particularly robust ticket price improvements again in our core Caribbean deployment.</p><p>We drove revenue yield growth by creating relative scarcity through our brand team success in increasing demand in excess of our measured capacity growth via ongoing guest experience efforts coupled with our continuing public relations efforts.</p><p>In fact we recently created three original TV programs that are airing on major U.S. networks, having already reached more than 40 million viewers during the large family-oriented programming blocks.</p><p>They are designed to entertain, to educate, and to engage viewers by showcasing exciting adventures, exotic cultures, beautiful ships, and popular global destinations with almost 80 original episodes.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CarMax Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. </p><p>I would now like to turn the call over to Katharine Kenny, Vice President, Investor Relations.</p><h1>Katharine Kenny</h1><p>Thank you, and good morning.

Total used units were driven by strong improvement conversion as well as by a small increase in store traffic. We believe the increase in used units was due to a variety of factors. These include improved store execution, our website redesign and related online capabilities which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads. </p><p>We continue to be very pleased with our core business as we again saw headwinds from tier three sales. The estimate used unit comps for our non-tier three customers were again significantly stronger this quarter at 9.8%. Our total web traffic was flat compared with the prior year quarter, while web leads performed well in the quarter. We continue to see a positive response to the website, with increased activity such as engagement with the search tool and car pages, as well as submitting leads. Our goal is to drive leads and convert more customers from the website to the store and finally to a sale.</p>", "company": "CarMax Group", "exec": [["Bill Nash", "CEO", "CarMax Group"], ["Tom Reedy", "CFO", "CarMax Group"], ["Katharine Kenny", "VP, IR", "CarMax Group"]], "analysts": [["Sharon Zackfia", "William Blair"], ["Brian Nagel", "Oppenheimer"], ["Craig Kennison", "Robert W.

This conference is being recorded at the request of Worthington Industries. If anyone objects, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce Ms. Cathy Lyttle, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ms. Lyttle, you may begin.</p><h1>Cathy Lyttle</h1><p>Thanks, Shawn. Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. A reminder that certain statements made on this call are forward looking within the meaning of the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results to differ from those suggested.</p><p>Our earnings release was issued yesterday evening. Please review it for more detail on those factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. This call is being recorded and will be made available later on our website.</p><p>On the call today are Chairman and CEO John McConnell; President and COO Mark Russell; Executive Vice President and CFO Andy Rose. John will begin with a few comments.</p><h1>John McConnell</h1><p>Thank you, Cathy. Welcome to all of you. Again this quarter, we delivered on our stated goal of improving our results on a year-over-year basis. That's what we said our objective would be and that is what we're doing. I want to thank all of our employees for their wonderful performances this quarter, producing record results. That's on top of record results in the first quarter as well.</p><p>So why don't we dig into the numbers and understand the results and the numbers more thoroughly this quarter? We will start with Andy.</p><h1>Andy Rose</h1><p>Thank you, John and good afternoon, everyone. The Company delivered another record quarter, with earnings per share of $0.75, excluding restructuring, up $0.15 or 25% from the prior year. We saw a strong performance from steel processing, modest improvement at cylinders and engineered cabs and another steady contribution from the joint ventures.</p><p>We achieved these record results in spite of continued market weakness in oil and gas and agriculture. Several unique items in the quarter were as follows. Inventory holding gains were nominal at $500,000 or $0.01 per share, as compared to a loss of $1.8 million or $0.02 per share in the prior-year quarter. Restructuring charges of $3.3 million were primarily related to legacy real estate sales and severances in cabs and cylinders.</p><p>Our current effective annual tax rate is 28.5% this quarter, down from our previous estimate of 31.2%. The decrease is driven by excess tax benefits from stock compensation expense attributable to our rising share price. Excluding these discrete items, the rate would have been around 33%.</p><p>Cylinders' operating income, excluding restructuring, was up $600,000 or 5% to $13.3 million. Strength in consumer products and alternative fuels is being offset by a weak oil and gas equipment market, where revenue is down 55%. Operating margins for the quarter were once again below normal, due to the impact of losses in oil and gas. Volume in this market has been anemic in calendar 2016, but there are signs that order activity is beginning to pick up with the price of oil stabilizing in the $50s.</p><p>Steel processing operating income was up $6.9 million, excluding restructuring, from the prior-year quarter to $35.8 million. Recent increases in flat steel pricing led to a modest inventory holding gain during the quarter. The business benefited from strong toll volumes and expanded margins in the coated business, but was negatively affected by higher manufacturing expenses due to production startup issues in our laser welding business and higher health care expense.</p>", "company": "Worthington Industries, Inc.", "exec": [["Cathy Lyttle", "VP Communications & IR ", "Worthington Industries, Inc."], ["John McConnell", "Chairman, CEO", "Worthington Industries, Inc."], ["Andy Rose", "EVP & CFO", "Worthington Industries, Inc."], ["Mark Russell", "President, COO", "Worthington Industries, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Phil Gibbs", "KeyBanc Capital Markets"], ["John Tumazos", "John Tumazos Very Independent Research"], ["Aldo Mazzaferro", "Macquarie Research"]], "date": "December 20, 2016, 14:30 ET", "ticker": "WOR", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

I\u2019ll cover the key headlines for the second quarter</p><p>First, we feel good about the margin expansion progress and EPS growth we delivered in the quarter, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of a 20% operating margin by fiscal \u201918. We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy, and where we\u2019re getting the ideas right, it\u2019s driving growth, whether that\u2019s Annie\u2019s and Larabar in the U.S., Haagen Dazs outside North America, or Old El Paso around the world.</p><p>Even so, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations in the second quarter. We didn\u2019t have enough marketing support, meaning the combination of trade, media and new product news to drive improved top line results, and on top of that we saw a slowdown in food industry growth in the U.S. in recent periods. So we\u2019re making targeted adjustments to our plans in the back half to find the right balance of investment and return while still driving significant margin expansion. Jeff Harmening will take you through more details on our second half business plans in a moment.</p><p>As a result of our sales trend, we\u2019re revising down our expectations for full year net sales and segment operating profit, but we remain on track to deliver our EPS and margin expansion guidance and we\u2019re increasing our free cash flow growth expectations thanks to continued good financial discipline. </p><p>Finally, we announced an important change to our organizational structure earlier this month. This change represents a significant step towards operating as a global company, allowing us to unlock global growth opportunities while continuing to drive efficiency and increase agility in our organization.</p>", "company": "General Mills Inc.", "exec": [["Ken Powell", "Chairman, Chief Executive Officer", "General Mills Inc."], ["Jeff Harmening", "President, Chief Operating Officer", "General Mills Inc."], ["Don Mulligan", "Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "General Mills Inc."], ["Jeff Siemon", "Finance Director, Investor Relations", "General Mills Inc."]], "analysts": [["Robert Moskow", "Credit Suisse"], ["Bryan Spillane", "Bank of America Merrill Lynch"], ["Andrew Lazar", "Barclays"], ["Ken Goldman", "JP Morgan"], ["David Palmer", "RBC Capital Markets"], ["Jason English", "Goldman Sachs"], ["Chris Growe", "Stifel"], ["Steven Strycula", "UBS"], ["David Driscoll", "Citi"]], "date": "December 20, 2016 8:30 am ET", "ticker": "GIS", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for the recap of our third quarter financial results. Here with me today are Jim Keane, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Sylvester, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Mossing, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Our third quarter earnings release, which crossed the wires yesterday, is accessible on our Web site. This conference call is being webcast and this webcast is a copyrighted production of Steelcase Inc. A replay of this call will also be posted to ir.steelcase.com later today.</p><p>Our discussions may include references to non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and details regarding the risks associated with the use of forward-looking statements are included in our earnings release. And we are incorporating, by reference into this conference call, the text of our Safe Harbor statement included in the release. Following our prepared remarks, we'll respond to questions from investors and analysts.</p><p>I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Keane.</p><h1>James Keane</h1><p>Thanks, Raj, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start by affirming that the results we reported at the close of business yesterday are the same as the preliminary results we provided earlier in the month. It wasn\u2019t a bad quarter, but we expected better, and the results were below the estimates we communicated in September.</p><p>The miss was in our Americas business and after further analysis it seems that the overall industry was growing more slowly than we expected. BIFMA has only reported shipments for the first two months of the quarter, but we did a little better than BIFMA for those two months. When we analyze our Americas business, our orders and shipments to larger contract customers were okay, both in terms of projects and the ongoing business that continues with those customers between projects.</p><p>We talked before about our win rates and those remain relatively strong. We saw some weakness in both orders and sales from smaller customers with whom we typically don\u2019t have contracts. It's possible that customer segments hold back a bit during the political uncertainty of the quarter, and we\u2019ve heard others in our industry point the softness in this segment of their business. On the other hand, it's also possible we are not catching our historical share of our dealers business in this segment.</p><p>We had our Americas dealers together in Grand Rapids earlier this fall, and we talked about how we can capture more of this business. And we\u2019re working on some new initiatives that should grow.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Finish Line Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, I would like to introduce the host of today\u2019s call, Finish Line Chief Financial Officer, Ed Wilhelm. Sir, you may begin.</p><h1>Ed Wilhelm</h1><p>Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Chief Executive Officer, Sam Sato. Before I get started, I need to remind you that this call may include forward-looking statements involving risk, management assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements expressed or implied. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to product demand and market acceptance risks, the effects of economic conditions, the effects of competitive products and pricing, the availability of products, management of growth and other risks detailed in our news release and SEC filings. The forward-looking statements included in this call are made only as of the date of this report and the company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition, we refer to certain non-GAAP adjusted metrics on this call. Explanation of these metrics and reconciliations to the nearest GAAP metrics can be found on the earnings release filed earlier today. Finally, as we announced in November, we are exploring strategic alternatives for JackRabbit including a potential sale. Therefore, we are treating that business as a discontinued operation and reporting its results separately from the rest of the company.</p><p>I will now turn the discussion over to Sam.</p><h1>Sam Sato</h1><p>Thanks, Ed and welcome everyone joining us today. Let me begin by saying that I am disappointed our results from continuing operations fell short of expectations. While significant parts of our business did well during the third quarter, clearly, there is more work to do, particularly with soft goods to drive consistent growth and improve profitability.</p><p>I am going to walk through how the third quarter unfolded and highlight the key drivers of our performance, then I will discuss some high level trends from Black Friday and the first weeks of December before shifting to an update of our fiscal \u201817 management agenda. Finally, Ed will detail the financials and our revised guidance before we take questions. Following the back-to-school season, we have projected sales to improve meaningfully over the remainder of the third quarter due in large part to easier comparisons as a result of our last year\u2019s supply chain disruption. Unfortunately, October and November were more challenging than we expected marked by weak traffic trends.</p><p>Q3 comps ended up 0.7%, including a mid single-digit increase in November. However, this was well below our expectations for a gain in the high single-digit range. It\u2019s important to look at our performance by category and division to get the complete story of the quarter. Soft goods was the major contributor to our third quarter sales and earnings shortfall as comps declined 37% with apparel and accessories both significantly underperforming our expectations.</p>", "company": "The Finish Line, Inc.", "exec": [["Ed Wilhelm", "Chief Financial Officer", "The Finish Line, Inc."], ["Sam Sato", "Chief Executive Officer", "The Finish Line, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Randy Konik", "Jefferies"], ["Susan Anderson", "FBR Capital Markets"], ["Camilo Lyon", "Canaccord Genuity"], ["Paul Trussell", "Deutsche Bank"], ["Erinn Murphy", "Piper Jaffray"], ["Michael Binetti", "UBS"], ["Eric Tracy", "Brean Capital"], ["Chris Svezia", "Wedbush"], ["Jim Chartier", "Monness, Crespi, Hardt"], ["Jonathan Komp", "Robert W.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the FactSet Research Systems Inc First Quarter Webcast Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

Rachel Stern, Senior Vice President, Strategic Resources and General Counsel, you may begin your conference.</p><h1>Rachel R. Stern</h1><p>Thank you, operator. Good morning and thanks to all of you for participating today. Welcome to FactSet\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. This conference call is being transcribed in real time by FactSet CallStreet service and is being broadcast live via the Internet at factset.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our website.</p><p>Our call will contain forward-looking statements reflecting management\u2019s expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect FactSet\u2019s business and financial results can be found in FactSet\u2019s filings with the SEC. Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, is a key metric for FactSet. Please recall that ASV is a snapshot view of client subscriptions and represents our forward-looking revenues for the next 12 months. Lastly, FactSet undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p><p>Joining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer and Maurizio Nicolelli, Chief Financial Officer. And now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Phil.</p><h1>Philip Snow</h1><p>Thanks Rachel, good morning everyone and welcome to today's call. Overtime FactSet has proven to have an extraordinarily resilient business model. We believe we are able to remain successful because we evolve and innovate and we excel at client service and in partnering with our clients. </p><p>The first quarter was challenging this year but we executed well on both the top and bottom line. ASV during the quarter grew 7.9% organically to 1.17 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 18% to $1.75 well above our guidance of $1.68 to $1.72. Growth was sustained across all regions. We saw strength particularly in Asia Pac and EMEA with ASV from international operations growing 9.3% organically to $405 million. Our non-U.S. ASV now represents 34.6% of our total up from 32.6% a year ago. </p><p>We did continue to see some cost pressure within the client base and when compared to Q1 of last year we saw an uptick in firm closures. That being said our growth this quarter was broadly distributed across a number of segments and user workflows. Let me highlight a few areas. First just over a year into our acquisition Portware continues to shine. With advanced analytics and cutting edge technology we\u2019ve grown market share in the EMS space. Portware had a strong quarter with accelerated client trading volumes and the addition of new clients. </p><p>Second, our multi asset class analytic solutions keep gaining momentum. We closed several significant deals this quarter and we continue to see strong growth in the risk and portfolio services. This product segment is a focused area of investment and we expect to see further positive results of our efforts as we move through the fiscal year of 2017. As the investment community moves increasingly towards multi asset class instruments, our offerings are advancing to meet their needs. </p>", "company": "FactSet Research Systems Inc.", "exec": [["Rachel R.

At the end of Q1, we delivered strong revenue and net income growth while margins remained steady. Consolidated revenues were $245.3 million, an increase of 14.5% year over year driven primarily by strong growth in our towables business. During the quarter, we successfully completed our transformative acquisition of Grand Design, which significantly expanded our penetration within the attractive still growing towables market segment. Our topline results benefited from approximately three weeks of Grand Design, which contributed $25.8 million of revenue.

Both U.S. and international irrigation equipment revenues decreased in the quarter while infrastructure revenues were slightly higher than a year ago.</p><p>Net earnings for the quarter were 900,000 or $0.08 per diluted share compared to $6.9 million or $0.62 per diluted share in the prior year. Irrigation equipment revenue in North America was lower than we expected that which led to under-absorbed factory overhead coupled with higher operating expenses, all contributed to the lower net earnings. The impact of foreign currency translation was slightly positive for the quarter in comparison to prior year affecting revenue by $1.3 million or 1% with minimal impact on operating income.</p><p>Sales for the irrigation segment in the first quarter were $89.9 million, an 11% decrease over the same quarter last year. In the U.S. irrigation market revenues were weaker than expected decreasing 15% from the same period last year.</p><p>The lower irrigation revenue in the quarter reflected lower unit volume partially offset by higher average selling prices from the pass-through of increased fuel costs. Our first quarter falls between selling season during harvest in North America and this periods revenue is usually not indicative of the next full selling season which begins in our second quarter and continues through the third quarter.</p><p>During the first quarter farmers are generally assessing harvest results and developing planting plans for the next year. We believe that farmers are taking a wait-and-see approach and deferring equipment purchases in the current environment. Revenues from other irrigation components including pump stations, filtration and technology products were also lower compared to the prior year reflecting the overall postharvest malaise in North America.</p><p>Farmer irrigation segment operating costs - operating margins decreased to 5.7% of sales from 12.5% of sales in the same quarter last year on the lower revenue under-absorbed factory overhead and higher operating expenses versus the prior year.</p><p>Record production of both corn and soybeans from the fall harvest in the U.S. is added to ending stocks and continues to keep downward pressure on commodity prices.

My name is Jason and I will be your operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and please note this conference is being recorded.</p><p>I will now turn the call over to Jim Herbert. Mr. Herbert, you may begin.</p><h1>Jim Herbert</h1><p>Thank you. And good morning, and welcome to our regular quarterly conference call slated for investors and analysts. Today as stated we'll be reporting to you the results of our second quarter that ended on November the 30th. And I'll remind you that some of the statements made here today could be termed as forward-looking statements and these forward-looking statements of course are subject to certain risk and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ from those that we discuss today. These risks that are associated with our business are covered in part in the company's Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>In addition to those of you who are joining us by live conference, I'll also welcome those who may be joined by way of simulcast on the worldwide web. Following comments this morning, we will entertain questions from participants who are joined by this live conference. And I'm joined today by Rick Calk, Neogen's Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Quinlan, Neogen's Chief Financial Officer. Some of you may remember Rick Current was with us for a lot of years and sometimes I mispronounce the names.</p><p>Earlier this morning, Neogen issued a press release announcing the results of our second quarter that ended on November the 30th. Net income for the second quarter of this 2017 fiscal year increased 23% to a $11.2 million or $0.29 per full diluted share. This is an increase from last years approximate $9 million that equated to $0.24 per share.</p><p>Current year-to-date income for the first six months is approximately $21 million or $0.55 per share. This compares to last years $18.4 million or $0.49 a share. Revenues for the second quarter increased by 14% to $90.7 million. This compares with the previous years second quarter revenues of $79.6 million. This increase this quarter was aided in part by some acquisitions.</p><p>The quarterly revenue and net income both represent second quarter records for 34-year old company. On a year-to-date basis, the revenues for the first half of the year increased by 13% to $174.4 million. That compares to last year's $154 million. And once again, I can say that a dedicated group of employees are around the world kept our success record going yet another quarter.</p><p>This second quarter was the 99th quarter in the past 104 quarters that Neogen reported revenue increases as compared with the previous year. This is a record that now spans 26 years and includes all consecutive quarters for the last 11 years. As I've said in the past, there just seems to be an implied determination that this growth record won't get broken on their watch.</p><p>Operating income for the quarter came in at 18.6%, compared to 18.4% the same quarter last year. Gross margins which are of course the major increment of operating income settled in at 48.1% as a percent of sales almost exactly matching last years second quarter.</p><p>Adverse currency translations continued to detract from the revenues, the gross profits and operating income. And when we last talked about three months ago, I thought that the currency trade winds could be behind us and at least be neutral as we move through the rest of the year.

We are joined today by David Storch, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Romenesko, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that comments made during the call may include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as noted in our news release and the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.</p><p>In providing forward-looking statements, the company assumes no obligation to provide updates to reflect future circumstances or anticipated or unanticipated events. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to AAR's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Storch.</p><h1>David Storch</h1><p>Thank you very much and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2017 results. Let me begin by just saying that John Holmes is not here with us in Chicago today. He is out on assignment, trying to make us some money. So, we\u2019ll try to answer questions related to his area more specifically. Before we begin the recap of the quarter, I\u2019d like to say how proud we are to have been awarded the Worldwide Aviation Support Services Contract by the U.S. State Department. </p><p>We are very pleased that the GAO found no merit to the award protest filed by DynCorp and that stands by the State Departments decision to award AAR the contract. We do believe and we see where DynCorp will be fighting some more on this contract. We feel at this stage it is, as we have along the road, fairly frivolous but we will fight them every way along the way and have a lot of confidence in the State Department\u2019s decision and a lot of confidence in our ability to bring value to the State Department.</p><p>Now the GAO decision clears the path now for AAR to assume operations and in the coming days we will work with the Department of State to establish a transition plan for INL/A. While we do not have more to share at this point, we expect to be in a position to provide further details of the transition timing, as well as guidance during our next call.</p><p>Now back to Q2 results. We had another solid quarter as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 35% from $0.26 last year to $0.35 in the current period. Although revenue was down 1.8% or $7.7 million for the quarter as a result of two significant item, one is the KC10 wind down, which we discussed before and secondly to drive more profitability to our MRO operations, we are transitioning our Lake Charles facility from a comprehensive MRO provider to a more limited operation providing principally only painting services.</p><p>As we continue to expand our MRO foot print early this month, we had our grand opening for Rockford, which is our sixth MRO constructed and designed to allow us to maintain every commercial aircraft up to and including the A380. For those of you not familiar, Rockford is about a 90 minute drive from downtown Chicago, it\u2019s accessible to a very large labor pool and we\u2019re very excited to have this facility here in the state of Illinois.</p><p>The facility was funded largely by the state and Federal Government and from local bankers and Rockford kicked in as well. We have very favorable lease agreement and we\u2019re very excited to move into the facility and start doing work for new customers. </p><p>Overall our Aviation Services business have continued to perform well and we captured several important contracts during the quarter. For example, we signed a five-year agreement valued at $125 million to provide power by the hour, component inventory management repair services to South African Airways Technical or SAAT. The agreement with SAAT represents a significant expansion or AAR in Africa and this win was largely due to the effort of our new President of AAR Africa, Cheryle Jackson, who has been working at the company since 2010 and President of AAR Africa in the last year and this is a very meaningful win for the company.</p>", "company": "AAR Corporation", "exec": [["David Storch", "Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "AAR Corporation"], ["Tim Romenesko", "Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer", "AAR Corporation"]], "analysts": [["Larry Solow", "CJS Securities"], ["Shannon Burke", "Gabelli and Co."]], "date": "December 21, 2016, 4:45 P.M.

And let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on today\u2019s call. In Q3, solid execution allowed us to continue to deliver double digit growth in a number of our financial metrics including revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. Some key highlights in quarter include, strong demand for our cloud-enabling technologies, which is reflected in the 32% constant currency growth in our application development related and other emerging technologies revenue. Our continuing customer traction is evident in our top 25 renewals that were up for renewal this quarter; all 25 renewed, and they did so at more than a 120% of their prior annual commitment.</p><p>As Frank will describe, we closed many large deals, including some of the largest deals in Red Hat\u2019s history, with strong cross-selling and longer term commitments from our customers. Our customers are increasingly adopting the cloud as part of their overall IP strategy, and are using Red Hat as a partner. We see customers deploying our cloud-enabling technologies both on-premise and in the public cloud. This group of hybrid cloud customers is growing revenue in the aggregate faster than customers that have not yet embraced these technologies. In fact, in Q3, we added hundreds of customer wins with products from our hybrid cloud portfolio, including several OpenStack deals that were over a $1 million. Also of note, we closed our second OpenShift deal over $10 million and another OpenShift deal over $5 million.</p>", "company": "Red Hat Inc", "exec": [["Tom McCallum", "VP of IR", "Red Hat Inc"], ["Jim Whitehurst", "President and CEO", "Red Hat Inc"], ["Frank Calderoni", "EVP, Operations and CFO", "Red Hat Inc"]], "analysts": [["Brent Thill", "UBS"], ["Raimo Lenschow", "Barclays Capital"], ["Walter Pritchard", "Citigroup"], ["Karl Keirstead", "Deutsche Bank"], ["Matt Hedberg", "RBC Capital Markets"], ["Gregg Moskowitz", "Cowen & Company"], ["Michael Turits", "Raymond James"], ["Steve Ashley", "Robert W.

This call is also being broadcast live over the web, and can be found on the IR section of our IR Web site. With us today are CalAmp's President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Burdiek and Chief Financial Officer, Rick Vitelle.</p><p>Before we begin, let me remind you that this call may contain forward-looking statements. While these forward looking statements reflect CalAmp's best current judgment, they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially differ from those forward-looking projections. Risk factors that could cause CalAmp's actual results to materially differ from its projections are discussed in the earnings release which was issued today, and is available on our Web site, and in our Fiscal 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed on April 20, 2016, with the SEC.</p><p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael Burdiek.</p><h1>Michael Burdiek</h1><p>Thank you for joining our call today. We reported third quarter revenues of $83.4 million, up 12% year-over-year, with GAAP basis gross margin of 42.1%, the highest in the company's history. Our third quarter bottom line results both for the GAAP basis net loss of $0.04 and the non-GAAP net income of $0.21 per diluted share, were adversely impacted by higher than anticipated legal expenses and foreign currency exchange losses, which Rick will address later in the call. We've become more optimistic about our near-term growth as visibility has improved markedly from early in the year when macro factors had negatively impacted demand for fleet telematics products in the U.S.</p><p>During the most recent quarter, our MRM telematics product sales reached the highest level of the past four quarters with telematics device sales for fleet and connected car applications reaching an all-time high. Furthermore, we sense increasing optimism among our U.S. customer base. This along with the market catalyst of the impending electronic logging device or ELD mandate create what we believe is a more favorable market backdrop than what we've experienced domestically for some time. More than 1 million commercial transport vehicles will be required to comply with the ELD mandate, which we expect will drive incremental demand for new in vehicle displays and telematics devices over the next two to three years. Internationally we also see reason to be optimistic as revenue from international customers reached 28.5% of consolidated results, an all-time high for the company. </p><p>Looking at our Q3 results in some detail. Sales of MRM telematics products were up 7% sequentially and we now have a vastly improved opportunity pipeline as compared to just a few quarters ago. The business with OmniTrax, one of our newest key customers is on course and we are now launching new programs with another key customer related to the win we announced during our last earnings call.</p>", "company": "CalAmp Corp", "exec": [["Nicole Noutsios", "IR", "CalAmp Corp"], ["Michael Burdiek", "CEO", "CalAmp Corp"], ["Rick Vitelle", "CFO", "CalAmp Corp"]], "analysts": [["Mike Walkley", "Canaccord Genuity"], ["Mike Crawford", "B.

These factors are outlined in our SEC filings. Consistent with prior quarters, we will utilize the one question, one follow-up rule in order to keep today\u2019s call to an hour.

I'd like to begin today by welcoming Rick Dillon to Actuant. As we announced a few weeks ago, Rick will become our next CFO. He brings an enormous and strong industrial background, he's going to make a great addition to the team, so welcome aboard Rick. Secondly, I'd like to recognize and thank Andy Lampereur for his service to Actuant. Andy is one of Actuant's founding team members and was a key contributor to the Company in its success and on behalf of Board of Directors, Andy thank you very much.</p><p>So starting over on Slide 4, I'm very pleased with our results in the quarter. We met our commitments in sales and earnings excluding the impact of restructuring and transition charges. Core sales were consistent with our guidance in all three segments and on a consolidated basis. We saw the expected stabilization and easier comparisons in our industrial and engineered solutions segment, and as expected our energy segment had difficult year-over-year top line performance given last year's non-recurring Hydratight project.</p><p>I'll cover the industry dynamics later in the call, but I would describe most of our end markets as sequentially stable. Diluted EPS excluding restructuring and transition charges were slightly above the $0.14 to $0.19 guidance range with benefit of lower than anticipated tax rate, which added about $0.02 a share. We generated $8 million of free cash flow in the quarter and the net debt leverage was about 2.7, both of which were within our guidelines and expectations.</p><p>Now, I'll turn the call over to Andy to run through the details in the quarter and then I'll come back with additional updates and guidance.</p><h1>Andy Lampereur</h1><p>Thanks, Randy, and good morning everyone. I am going to start my review with the bridge schedule on Slide 4, which removes both the restructuring and previously announced transition charges from our GAAP results to align them with what was contemplated in our guidance for the quarter. Excluding the combined $0.12 a share drag from these two items, our adjusted operating profit was $19 million, and our adjusted EPS was $0.20 a share, which is a $0.01 above our $0.14 to $0.19 a share guidance range.</p>", "company": "Actuant Corporation", "exec": [["Karen Bauer", "Communications and Investor Relations Leader", "Actuant Corporation"], ["Randy Baker", "CEO", "Actuant Corporation"], ["Andy Lampereur", "CFO", "Actuant Corporation"], ["Rick Dillon", "Incoming CFO", "Actuant Corporation"]], "analysts": [["Alison Poliank", "Wells Fargo"], ["Ann Duignan", "JPMorgan"], ["Jeff Hammond", "KeyBanc Capital Markets"], ["Scott Graham", "Bank of Montreal"], ["Mig Dobre", "Baird"], ["Charley Brady", "SunTrust Robinson Humphrey"], ["Justin Bergner", "Gabelli & Company"]], "date": "December 21, 2016 11:00 AM ET", "ticker": "ATU", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today to highlight our financial results and other activities for our 2016 fiscal year. Earlier this afternoon, we released our press release with summary results for our 2016 fiscal year, including a table showing our results by segment, which separately breaks out our Xcede loss. You may want to refer to this press release and our 10-K for specific information during the call. If you have that release available now, you will note the table with columnar results for our optics, research and biomedical segments for both 2016 and 2015. Rob will summarize our results in a few minutes, I would like to highlight some of the \u2013 both the positive and negative events, which characterized Dynasil\u2019s 2016 year.</p><p>You can see from our results, we had major improvements in revenue and net operating income for our core operating businesses in 2016. I am happy to report our revenue increased by approximately $3 million after accounting for the Xcede loss, we earned net income of $300,000 in 2016 as compared to a net loss of $400,000 in 2015. The $3 million revenue improvement in 2016 represents an increase of 7% over 2015 and is comprised of revenue increases in both our optics and contract research segments. Our optics segment revenue increased 9% year-over-year even after accounting for the Brexit devaluation, which resulted in $500,000 revenue hit in June through September of 2016. And despite continued softness in funding of research across multiple federal agencies, our Contract Research segment revenue increased 5% year-over-year.</p><p>Net operating income, one of our key performance metrics, increased from $976,000 in 2015 to $1,775,000 in 2016 from our optics segment or 82% increase. For our research segment, the increase was $875,000 to $974,000 or 11%. This growth was offset by growth in the cost of our Xcede hemostat development project. However, it should be noted that our core businesses generated net operating income of $2,750,000 for 2016.</p>", "company": "Dynasil Corporation of America", "exec": [["Patty Kehe", "Investor Relations", "Dynasil Corporation of America"], ["Peter Sulick", "Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President", "Dynasil Corporation of America"], ["Rob Bowdring", "Chief Financial Officer", "Dynasil Corporation of America"]], "analysts": [["Robert Cooper", "Private Investor"], ["Joe Furst", "Furst Associates"]], "date": "December 21, 2016 17:00 ET", "ticker": "DYSL", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

This conference call, including audio and slides, is also being webcast from our Investor Relations website at investors.micron.com. </p><p>In addition, our website contains the earnings press release filed a short while ago and supplemental information including quarterly operational and financial metrics and guidance, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, slides used during today\u2019s conference call, and a convertible debt and capped call dilution table.</p><p>Today\u2019s call will be approximately 60 minutes in length. A webcast replay will be available on our website for one year. We encourage you to monitor our website at micron.com throughout the quarter for the most current information on the company, including information on the various financial conferences that we will be attending and our 2017 analyst conference which will be held on Thursday, February 2nd. You can also follow us on Twitter @MicronTech.</p><p>As a reminder, the matters we will be discussing today, includes forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-Q and 10-K for a complete discussion of these important factors and other risks that may affect our future results.</p><p>Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after today\u2019s date to conform these statements to actual results.</p><p>I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mark.</p><h1>Mark Durcan</h1><p>Thank you, Ivan. For fiscal Q1 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $3.97 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 26% and net income of $335 million or $0.32 per share. Revenue, gross margin, operating income all exceeded our guidance. Operating cash flow was $1.1 billion. In the first quarter, we saw an acceleration of the positive market conditions to begin this fall. </p><p>For the industry, supply is slowing demand is stronger on a number of key segments and inventory is at low levels. Prices have been strengthening on a like-for-like basis across all leading SDRAM and NAND products and we see this trend continuing into the current quarter. </p><p>To give you some perspective on pricing dynamics. After declining for roughly 18 months, PC DRAM ASPs are up 50% to 60% compared to the trough pricing driven by an improvement in demand, with slightly low inventory levels and the impact of supply shifts to other segments. In contrast to all other DRAM segments declined substantially less over the same period and are recovering at a slower rate. </p>", "company": "Micron Technology Inc.", "exec": [["Ivan Donaldson", "IR", "Micron Technology Inc."], ["Mark Durcan", "CEO", "Micron Technology Inc."], ["Ernie Maddock", "CFO", "Micron Technology Inc."]], "analysts": [["Chris Hemmelgarn", "Barclays"], ["Vijay Rakesh", "Mizuho"], ["Mark Delaney", "Goldman Sachs"], ["Rajvindra Gill", "Needham and Company"], ["Timothy Arcuri", "Cowen"], ["Joe Moore", "Morgan Stanley"], ["Steven Fox", "Cross Research"], ["Chris Danely", "Citigroup"], ["John Pitzer", "Credit Suisse"], ["Jagadish Iyer", "Summit Redstone Partners"], ["Harlan Sur", "JP Morgan"], ["Romit Shah", "Nomura"], ["David Wong", "Wells Fargo"], ["Kevin Cassidy", "Stifel"], ["Mark Newman", "Bernstein"]], "date": "December 21, 2016 04:30 PM ET", "ticker": "MU", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Good morning, everyone, happy holidays. And thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. We\u2019re excited to be with you this morning for our first call as ConAgra Brands, with the spin-off of Lamb Weston successfully behind us we have embarked on a new era as a branded pure-play CPG company. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress to get to this point. But more importantly, we\u2019re confident that we have a lot of run-way to deliver significant improvement and profitability in the years to come.</p><p>On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m going to take few minutes to provide some context around where we are and our expectations going forward. I\u2019ll also touch on the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic plans. I\u2019ll cover a few highlights from the quarter and Dave will get into the details before we take your questions. For those of you who are able to join us at our Investor Day in October, you will recall that I left you with six key takeaways about the business and our plans for the future. First, we have clearly moved to beyond our roots as an ad company, and later a global conglomerate.</p><p>ConAgra Brands today is a much different organization. And as we discussed with you in October, the differences aren\u2019t just structural. Our culture has fundamentally evolved. The team has developed the focus and discipline required to succeed. Hand-in-hand with these cultural changes, the revenue management capabilities we\u2019ve developed and the deep commitment to cost and complexity reduction efforts now embedded in our organization. We expect these efforts will fuel additional margin expansion overtime, which in-turn will fuel improved growth and cash flow. It\u2019s also worth repeating that we\u2019re in a unique position to reshape our portfolio in an efficient manner.

Please go ahead.</p><h1>Brian Walker</h1><p>Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Yesterday we announced our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Our consolidated sales and orders for the quarter were $578 million and $576 million respectively and GAAP earnings per share were $0.53.</p><p>Sales for the quarter were lower than we expected. The softness was primarily in our North America contract-furnishing segment as ELA specialty and consumer each delivered mid to high single digit growth for the quarter. In the face of challenging comparisons to the prior year and an uncertain near term business environment, consolidated orders posted a modest decline this quarter particularly in the North America and Specialty segment, both of which experienced double-digit organic order growth last year.</p><p>Adjusted earnings per share of $0.54 for the quarter met our expectations and the organization did a good job delivering manufacturing efficiencies and adjusting spending to the demand levels across the business.</p><p>Before Jeff and Kevin provide a more detailed breakdown of the results for the quarter, I\u2019d like to share my perspectives on the economic backdrop as well as the overall direction of the business.</p><p>Despite the impact of low energy cost and interest rates, growth and productivity in the U.S. and abroad remained tepid. The contentious political environment in Europe and the recent U.S. elections have combined to increase volatility over the past several months.</p><p>Contract furniture industry in North America has echoed this mix environment, with choppy order levels and lower architectural buildings activity at odds with support of service sector employment and non-residential construction activity.</p><p>Our North American business has reflected this cautious environment. Sales and order rates within our North America segment did not meet our expectation this quarter. On an organic basis, net sales decreased 5% and new orders were down 3% compared to the year ago period. This quarter\u2019s results were challenged by a particularly difficult prior year comparison and a competitive pricing environment. Looking at the data on a two-year stack basis, order growth for the second quarter was approximately 3%. This exceeds the growth within a broader North American contract industry, which over the same time averaged closer to 1%. This data reflects the project nature of our business and the broader uneven demand patterns.</p>", "company": "Herman Miller, Inc.", "exec": [["Kevin Veltman", "VP, IR", "Herman Miller, Inc."], ["Brian Walker", "President & CEO", "Herman Miller, Inc."], ["Jeffrey Stutz", "EVP & CFO", "Herman Miller, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Matt McCall", "Seaport Global"], ["Kathryn Thompson", "Thompson Research Group"]], "date": "December 22, 2016, 09:30 AM ET", "ticker": "MLHR", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Mike?</p><h1>Mike Kaminski</h1><p>Thank you, Dan. Good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll begin with a few high level comments and Dan will provide more detail on our financial results later in the call.</p><p>In 2016, our results demonstrate the fact that we made strong progress in our ongoing strategy to transform Landauer. Throughout the year, we executed against our strategic, operational and financial objectives and our underlining results for the fourth quarter reflect the continued momentum on that front. Similar to last quarter, my comments regarding the results will exclude the impact from the sale of Radon and Medical Products businesses in order to provide a more relevant comparison of our business trends for the quarter and the year. In addition, our fourth-quarter earnings on GAAP basis were impacted by incremental tax expenses associated with the sale of the Medical Products business which I will exclude from my comments.</p><p>Using this methodology, revenue for the quarter was $36.8 million essentially flat with 2015. For comparison purposes, the fourth quarter of 2015 included $2.2 million in revenue related to the shipment of military product. As we have discussed previously, military shipments do not recur on a constant basis and we did not ship any products in the fourth quarter of 2016. Recurring revenue service lines were up 5.5% from the prior year period. I'll discuss recurring revenue trends in more detail in the year-to-year comparisons.</p><p>Imaging physics continue to pace our revenue growth with a strong quarter growing 19% sequentially and 32% over prior year. Net income in the quarter was impacted by the reduction of capital shipments offset by our operational cost control efforts which enabled us to improve our margins and increase net income by $300,000 or 7.5% over prior year. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.44 per share for the quarter.</p>", "company": "Landauer, Inc.", "exec": [["Dan Fujii", "Chief Financial Officer", "Landauer, Inc."], ["Mike Kaminski", "President and Chief Executive Officer", "Landauer, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Rob Mason", "Robert W.

Chris?</p><h1>Christopher Anzalone</h1><p>Thanks Vince. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. We normally review highlights of the progress we made during the previous year and clearly there were many notable accomplishments. However, this is not a typical year-end earnings call. So I'd like to review the recent events and give an update about what we're focused on right now. As you know, on November 29, we announced that we made the decision to halt development of all drug candidates that have employed a liver targeted IV administered DPC delivery vehicle. That specific structure of DPC is also known as EX1. This included all three of our clinical candidates, ARC-520 and ARC-521 for chronic hepatitis B infection and ARC-AAT for alpha-1 liver disease. This is not a decision that we took lightly and obviously not what we expected for the EX1 platform. It was however necessary as a regulatory path for products containing EX1 has become increasingly uncertain.</p><p>On November 8, the FDA notified us that the Heparc-2004 study of ARC-520 was being placed on clinical hold in the United States. This was prompted by deaths at the highest dose of an ongoing non-human primate toxicology study using EX1 that was being conducted to support long-term dosing. In subsequent discussions and review by regulators, investigators and ethics committees, in 17 countries in which we had clinical sites for our 520, our 520 and ARC-AAT, it became apparent that the regulatory concerns expressed by the FDA would delay our studies globally. We believe that resolving those regulatory concerns would at minimum require additional long-term non-clinical toxicology studies and would likely cause a delay of 18 months or more in our clinical programs.</p>", "company": "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals", "exec": [["Vincent Anzalone", "VP of IR", "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals"], ["Christopher Anzalone", "President and CEO", "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals"], ["Ken Myszkowski", "CFO", "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals"], ["Bruce Given", "COO and Head of R&D", "Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals"]], "analysts": [["Ted Tenthoff", "Piper Jaffrey"], ["Andrew Tsai", "RBC Capital Markets"], ["Katherine Xu", "William Blair"]], "date": "December 14, 2016 04:30 PM ET", "ticker": "ARWR", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

{"entry": {"title": "Annual Outlook Investor Meeting Conference Call", "transcript": "<p>Hey, good afternoon, everybody. I guess when you sell NBC, they kick you out of 30 Rock eventually, so we have kept the temperature more or less the same, which I\u2019m sure you are happy about. So welcome, it\u2019s good to be with you. And I am just going to start right in, go through kind of an overview of the company that I am happy to take questions at the end.</p><p>So just at the top, just give you a sense of \u2013 probably the most optimistic we have been about the U.S. economy in a long time. I think some of the reports we mentioned tax reform and things like that we see is generally positive. Lot of our markets are still pretty strong. I think the headwind remains kind of when is the oil sector and related industries going to recover. We have seen some firming of the price.</p><p>And then I think there is kind of, let\u2019s say, five big themes I would have you think about as we go through the presentation. The first one is both Alstom and Baker Hughes are good deals. They add to the company financially and strategically and you are going to see that as I go through the presentation. Digital additive are becoming more real. There are horizontal capabilities inside the company that I think can drive a lot more productivity and also drive growth over time. We have a lot of cost out ideas that are coming from our investment in digital and our experience in the Alstom integration, which we are adding to our base plan.</p><p>We are a global company. We think we have got a ton of opportunities outside the United States today and in the future and we will continue to invest to realize those opportunities and the entire team is really committed to execute the $2 bridge by 2018 and I will give you the details of how we expect to get there as I go through the presentation. So you will see those throughout the rest of presentation. This is basically the scorecard for 2016 and I think the message I would give you is that this is consistent with what we talked about in the third quarter earnings call. No change to how we think about EPS, operating EPS. We see free cash flow and dispositions heading towards the marker we gave you in October. Same way cash return to investors and we increased the dividend again last week, so we continue to make progress on returning cash for investors. So we kind of see the fourth quarter coming in more or less the way we talked about in October.</p><p>Again, portfolio, GE Store, so strong businesses, GE Store, two of the big investment areas that we focus on are really harnessing the value of the digitization of our assets and additive manufacturing and really positioned to be a leader in productivity as we look at the future. So the way we have kind of structured the presentation today is to talk through how we have improved the portfolio by making it simpler and deeper, how we are leveraging the GE Store to improve organic growth and margins and how that plays into the $2 share by 2018 and the bridge. So, despite the oil and gas headwind, so that\u2019s kind of the presentation that I will take you through today.</p><p>Here is just \u2013 again, so you have got this in mind as you are going through the rest of the presentation. We are basically going to go from $1.48 to $1.52 this year, $1.60 to $1.70 in 2017 and $2 in 2018. And I would give you two walks that help you see kind of how we get there. The first one goes back to April of 2015 and what\u2019s changed, right? So clearly, the oil and gas markets are tougher than we saw in April of \u201815. We think that cost us $0.10 or $0.15 a share. Capital allocation and this is incremental buyback, the impact of LM and Baker Hughes over that time period as it pertains to the M&A that\u2019s different, net of dispositions, so that\u2019s about $0.05, and then an incremental $0.10 a share of cost takeout, some of which is already underway, and more I will talk about this plan in \u201817 and \u201818. So, that\u2019s one walk from, let\u2019s say, April of 2015 until today.</p>", "company": "General Electric Company", "exec": [["Jeffrey Immelt", "Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "General Electric Company"], ["Jeffrey Bornstein", "Chief Financial Officer", "General Electric Company"]], "analysts": [["Jeffrey Sprague", "Vertical Research Partners"], ["Deane Dray", "RBC Capital Markets"], ["Joe Ritchie", "Goldman Sachs"]], "date": "December 14, 2016 15:00 ET", "ticker": "GE", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

I am Michael Bumby, Merus\u2019 Chief Financial Officer. We have filed our financial statements and MD&A on SEDAR and issued a Q4 2016 earnings press release this morning. </p><p>Investors should refer to those documents for more financial details, a more in-depth review of our results of operations and a more comprehensive list of the factors and risks that could cause our results of operations and business outcomes to materially differ from those expressed or implied on today\u2019s call.

Barry?</p><h1>Barry Fishman </h1><p>Thanks, Michael and I welcome everyone to today\u2019s call. I will start by providing some highlights of the quarter and the fiscal year. After my opening remarks, we will be pleased to take your questions. </p><p>In fiscal 2016, we roughly doubled the size of our sales base after acquiring the seven established products from UCB and Sanofi. Since the acquisition in the second quarter, the Merus team has been focused in four main areas. First, integrating our acquired products, second, strengthening our business processes and systems, third, building our pan-European team and platform, and finally, refocusing our business development efforts on growth assets.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was $11.6 million in the quarter and $43.2 million for the fiscal year. Stronger than anticipated sales were offset by increased operating expenses, resulting in fiscal 2016 adjusted EBITDA within, but at the lower end of our guidance.</p><p>2016 was a transformative year for Merus Labs. We evolved into a true regional specialty pharmaceutical company selling 12 branded products in 36 countries with a strong pan-European platform. Our near-term priority is to optimize the profitability of our diverse product line.</p><p>Fiscal 2016 was marked by substantial product acquisition and integration efforts. During the year, we completed the integration of the Novartis assets, and acquired seven additional products in fiscal Q2, 2016. To support this significant increase in scale and scope we made necessary one-time and ongoing investments in people, capabilities, systems and working capital. Merus now has a solid pan-European platform and is sharply focused on cost savings and sales optimization initiatives with a high-performing team that is well positioned to deliver.</p><p>Gross Basis Revenue for the quarter was $34.3 million, above our expectations. Wholesaler inventory levels at year-end were approximately two weeks or just under $5 million in sales value above normal levels driven by three items. First the transfer of nitrates inventory from UCB affiliates directly to our customers. Second, increased safety stock on Sintrom in advance of the change of manufacturing site, and third, initial stocking of Emselex to support new launches in Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>", "company": "Merus Labs International Inc.", "exec": [["Michael Bumby", "Chief Financial Officer", "Merus Labs International Inc."], ["Barry Fishman", "Chief Executive Officer", "Merus Labs International Inc."]], "analysts": [["Noel Atkinson", "Clarus Securities"], ["Martin Landry", "GMP Securities"], ["Alan Ridgeway", "Scotia Capital "], ["David Novak", "Cormark Securities"], ["Joseph Walewicz", "Laurentian Securities"], ["Prakash Gowd", "CIBC"]], "date": "December 14, 2016, 8:30 AM ET", "ticker": "MSLI", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

At the end of the fourth quarter, our assets under management were approximately $26.9 billion compared to $25.5 billion for the same period last year.

This quarter we had revenue of $623.1 million, up 4% year-over-year and EPS from continuing operations was $1.99 versus $1.89 last year, excluding one-time items, driven by excellent results in children's trade publishing and international.</p><p>Children's book publishing and distribution growth was driven by our strong trade publishing lineup led by Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the illustrated edition and the original screenplay book for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which was released late in the quarter.</p><p>Long-standing and newer fans of the world of Harry Potter have responded with great global support of the new Fantastic Beasts franchise and we look forward to the rollout of the next installments in years to come.</p><p>On top of Harry Potter's strength, our core trade publishing grew with new titles including Dog Man by Dav Pilkey, Ghosts by Raina Telgemeier, and Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes, which is the first of the multi-book series based on the popular Five Nights at Freddy's game franchise.</p><p>As we told you on previous calls, our strategy for school, clubs, and fairs is to improve profitability by reducing costs on flat revenue. In book fairs, we are on-track to deliver annual revenue roughly in line with last year, while focusing on more profitable execution as we match our resources to each school size, interest and ability to conduct book fairs.</p><p>As such we reduced the number of fairs held in the second quarter, but reduced revenue -- increased revenue per fair by 7%. In book clubs, our adjustments to our catalog mailings strategy succeeded in lowering costs that also had a more adverse impact on sales than expected.

Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant improvement, returning to positive growth in revenues, profits and cash flow, while also positioning ISSC to capitalize on emerging opportunities expected to arise as NextGen mandates rapidly approach. We believe these accomplishments are even more noteworthy as they were achieved while doubling our investment in internally funded development and managing outgoing litigation. Fiscal 2016 was also a year on which we modified our strategy and realigned our resource system, all which now service as a solid foundation from which the company can continue to grow.</p><p>We transitioned from a heavy reliance on customer funded engineering revenues to a much more -- much greater proportion of more profitable production contracts. This is no more clearly illustrated than in our fourth quarter results where we generated revenue from current backlog as well as growing a stream of booking ship orders, virtually all of which were production based. This led to expanded gross margin and a returning to the level that were historically achieved. Over the past year, we've also significantly increased our commitment to internally develop new products and expanding our sales distribution channels. The result has been greater ability to create new products that we believe we can quickly capitalize on current market needs and a wider reach into markets both internationally and domestically.</p><p>We are especially enthusiastic with the progress of the Utility Management System. It is smoothly transitioned into its initial production cycle. The Utility Management System or UMS replaces over 20 independent better rated systems, driving such systems as environmental control and cabin pressurization. This allows customers, our customers to explore our system open architecture to create and maintain their own software and hardware solutions profoundly reducing their initial cost and subsequent maintenance cost. It is now scheduled for production, aircraft and new production aircraft and is showing interest broadly throughout the industry. </p><p>Our goal is to build on progress accomplished over the past year so we can continue to achieve consistent improvement year-over-year. </p>", "company": "Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc.", "exec": [["Geoffrey Hedrick", "Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc."], ["Shahram Askarpour", "President", "Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc."], ["Rell Winand", "Chief Financial Officer", "Innovative Solutions and Support, Inc."]], "analysts": [["David Campbell", "Thompson Davis & Company"], ["Scott Lewis", "Lewis Capital Management"]], "date": "December 15, 2016 10:00 AM ET", "ticker": "ISSC", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

We moved our new Palestine, Texas plan to full production in October. We are near completion of our new St. Pauls North Carolina complex. We made progress on sales of prepared chicken, we finish the year in a competitive position in our industry, and we have no debt on our balance sheet. While we have room to improve our performance, I\u2019m very grateful for the efforts of our growers and our employees during this past fiscal year and look forward to working with them to capture the opportunities available to us during the coming year.</p><p>With that introduction, I will ask Lampkin and Mike to provide details on the quarter, and I will return after they finish to discuss our focus during fiscal 2017 and answer your questions.</p><h1>Lampkin Butts</h1><p>Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. This is Lampkin. As Joe said, overall market prices for chicken declined during the year but we benefited from lower grain cost for the year.

For information about factors that could affect Apogee\u2019s business and financial results can be found in our SEC filings.</p><p>Joe will now give you a brief overview of the results and Jim will cover the financials. After they conclude, Joe and Jim will answer your questions. Joe?</p><h1>Joe Puishys</h1><p>Thank you. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Apogee\u2019s fiscal \u201917 third quarter conference call. Once again we delivered strong quarterly results as we successfully executed our strategies to grow through new products, new geographies and new markets. At the same time, our backlog, awards, bidding levels support our outlook for sustained growth in fiscal \u201817 and beyond. With our continued confidence in our ability to deliver strong financial performance in fiscal 2017, we have increased our earnings per share guidance for the full year, while maintaining our outlook for double-digit topline growth. Our growth strategies include pursuing acquisitions that expand our market opportunities. And to that end, yesterday we closed on the acquisition of Sotawall, a premier curtainwall company with annual revenues of approximately $100 million. It's a great addition to the Apogee family and I'll provide more color on this strategic transaction after my comments on the quarter.</p><p>Of course our results are exclusive of this acquisition. Our strong top and bottom line performance in the third quarter driven by our architectural businesses which are executing strategies for long-term growth in operational improvement. Our architectural businesses are operating well, increasing productivity and maximizing pricing and margins while leveraging volume growth. Our results reflect the position of competitive strength we've established in the commercial construction market. Our six architectural businesses in our three segments performed well in all aspects. Every business grew topline well above end markets, with improved gross and operating margins. Our lean initiatives are contributing to solid profit conversion and adding to our volume leveraging, resulting in triple-digit basis point margin improvement.</p><p>And although our LSO business is experiencing soft end market, this business continues to drive impressive margins and has a terrific future as we expand into new markets with our intellectual property. And Q4 is shaping up to be a nice quarter for LSO. Our strategic focus is to better position Apogee\u2019s over - Apogee\u2019s performance over a cycle and achieve earnings stability in any market environment. Strategic successes in the third quarter that will help reduce cyclicality including growing our share of mid-sized projects in architectural glass and expanding penetration of our retrofit initiative. Another accomplishment in the fiscal third quarter that will help us sustain our growth momentum was finalizing an increase in our credit facility to support our acquisition efforts giving a substantial borrowing capacity. Before I turn to our acquisition announced yesterday, I'd like to note that in our earnings press release and our discussion here we're now reporting backlog by segment. As our mix of business has evolved, backlog is a meaningful metric at the segment level. It is not a meaningful consolidated Apogee metric. It is most important in our services segment, which has very lumpy input as our actual average projects size is between $15 million and $20 million. And project center backlog in total on a day to contractors executed.</p>", "company": "Apogee Enterprises, Inc.", "exec": [["Mary Ann Jackson", "IR", "Apogee Enterprises, Inc."], ["Joe Puishys", "CEO", "Apogee Enterprises, Inc."], ["Jim Porter", "CFO", "Apogee Enterprises, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Chris Moore", "CJS Securities"], ["Sam Eisner", "Goldman Sachs"], ["Jon Braatz", "Kansas City Capital"]], "date": "December 15, 2016 10:00 AM ET", "ticker": "APOG", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

We believe the increase in sales is an important validation of our technology and of our business plan. Through collaboration and supply agreements, our KLH products are now a key ingredient in multiple clinical stage immunotherapies with more clinical opportunities available for future growth.</p><p>As a reminder Stellar KLH is a high value protein, it's very large and complex, and it has never been synthesized. Yet, it has been used for decades throughout the world to study immune system function due to its long-term safety record and well known effectiveness it\u2019s now being used as a carrier molecule across the field of active immunotherapies. The growth of this field has the potential to fundamentally change how many diseases are treated and in turn has broad long lasting implications on the sourcing and production of the KLH molecule.</p>", "company": "Stellar Biotechnologies Inc.", "exec": [["Gary Koppenjan", "Investor Relations", "Stellar Biotechnologies Inc."], ["Mark McPartland", "Vice President, Corporate Development", "Stellar Biotechnologies Inc."], ["Frank Oakes", "President and Chief Executive Officer", "Stellar Biotechnologies Inc."], ["Kathi Niffenegger", "Chief Financial Officer", "Stellar Biotechnologies Inc."]], "analysts": [["Jason McCarthy", "Maxim Group"], ["Brian Marckx", "Zacks Investment Research"]], "date": "December 15, 2016 01:30 PM ET", "ticker": "SBOT", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Mike?</p><h1>Mike Shaunnessy</h1><p>Thank you, Casey. Good afternoon and thanks for joining our call today. During our second fiscal quarter, we continued to be impacted by road construction at Club Fortune, which wasn\u2019t completed until the last week of October and in Washington, a slightly softer hold compared to the prior year although in the normal range. Our business levels in Washington were fairly flat. Table games whole percent on a year-to-date basis continues below our historical average.</p><p>In addition, during the quarter, we saw continuing erosion in the poker business in the Washington market, with our poker revenues down approximately $300,000. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA in Washington was down $500,000 for the quarter. The whole percentage, of course, is a self-correcting challenge, but the significant additional marketing and promotion dollars being spent by our competitors, chasing a dwindling poker business, we evaluated our poker offerings in the market with an eye toward consolidating play to improve margins and also to provide an opportunity for us to offer different games in their place at certain locations.</p><p>We closed our poker tables at the Seatac property, consolidating play at the nearby Renton property in the southern market. In the northern part of the Seattle market, we closed our poker tables at the Crazy Moose-Mountlake Terrace and consolidated play at the nearby Club Hollywood property. The table closures reduced costs while transferring revenues to our other properties.</p><p>Last quarter, we discussed a ballot initiative to increase the Washington State minimum wage to $11 an hour effective January 1, 2017. That proposal passed and will go into effect January 1. As indicated previously, we anticipate that our current payroll expense will increase by approximately $1.2 million in calendar year 2017. We have identified numerous initiatives to mitigate the overall financial impact of this change. Without getting too specific for competitive reasons, these include pricing opportunities, operating hours of our facilities, revised game occupancy standards, table minimums, employment policies and practices and benefits. These initiatives, which are within our control to implement, are anticipated to offset approximately $800,000 of that wage impact. We do not expect any significant revenue impact from these changes, but we keep an eye on the market and the competition and follow changes as we move forward. Implementation of some of these initiatives has already begun and they will vary by property and timing as we continue to reassess any impact, positive or negative and adjust accordingly.</p>", "company": "Nevada Gold & Casinos, Inc", "exec": [["Casey Stegman", "Investor Relations", "Nevada Gold & Casinos, Inc"], ["Mike Shaunnessy", "Chief Executive Officer", "Nevada Gold & Casinos, Inc"], ["Jim Meier", "Chief Financial Officer", "Nevada Gold & Casinos, Inc"]], "analysts": [["John Schneider", "Cetera Financial Group"], ["Shane Martin", "Stonegate Capital Partners"], ["Colin King", "Kirr, Marbach & Company"]], "date": "December 15, 2016 16:30 ET", "ticker": "UWN", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Please go ahead, sir.</p><h1>Ken Bond</h1><p>Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

And these forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.</p><p>As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with few prepared remarks.</p><p>With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.</p><h1>Safra Catz</h1><p>Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter, I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3, as well as give some direction on FY17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.</p><p>Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud business, while our key competitors are slowing down, but more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue next fiscal year, when the transition will be largely complete. While the investments we\u2019ve made to transition our business to the cloud have limited our ability to expand earnings per share near-term, they\u2019ve been important to ensure that Oracle remains the technology leader. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results an EPS and cash flow that grow even faster.</p><p>We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movement were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in currency headwind of 1% in total revenue, 2% in some revenue categories and one penny to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also negatively impacted EPS by a second penny. None of this was in my guidance for the quarter.</p>", "company": "Oracle Corporation", "exec": [["Ken Bond", "SVP", "Oracle Corporation"], ["Safra Catz", "CEO", "Oracle Corporation"], ["Mark Hurd", "CEO", "Oracle Corporation"], ["Larry Ellison", "Chairman and CTO", "Oracle Corporation"]], "analysts": [["John DiFucci", "Jefferies"], ["Mark Moerdler", "Sanford Bernstein"], ["Keith Weiss", "Morgan Stanley"], ["Kash Rangan", "Bank of America Merrill Lynch"], ["Ross MacMillan", "RBC Capital Market"], ["Sarah Hindland", "Macquarie"], ["Michael Turits", "Raymond James"], ["Raimo Lenschow", "Barclays"]], "date": "December 15, 2016 05:00 PM ET", "ticker": "ORCL", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

I'm joined today by Peter Blackmore, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer, and by Becky Cranna, our Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>As is customary practice, I will now review our disclosure statement. Our discussion today will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution or CAFD. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures has been provided in our call presentation published on TerraForm Power's Web-site today.</p><p>Please note that this call contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.

It has been a long while since we have had an investor call. It has taken a lot of hard work by many to get to this point. Completing the 10-K for 2015 and the Q for Q1 2016 is obviously a very meaningful milestone. I want all of you to also understand that we are very focused on completing the Q2 and Q3 filings, so we are once again fully compliant well before the March NASDAQ deadline.</p><p>Before we comment on the other significant progress we have made, I want to briefly discuss the strategic alternatives review that is underway. As we said in the press release accompanying the 10-K, we have a well-defined process and timeline and have asked bidders to provide firm pricing by a defined date in early January, with binding bids due shortly after that. The Board of Directors will then consider the bids and, if appropriate, recommend one of the bids to approval by our shareholders. We have excellent advisors supporting us in this process, Morgan Stanley, Centerview and Sullivan & Cromwell. I am sure that you will understand that we shall not be providing any further detail on this matter during this call.</p><p>This call is primarily to review the 2015 and Q1 2016 financials. But before we do that, it is very appropriate to also highlight the progress that we have made in the last year. 2016 was a very challenging year for our Company and it is a great credit for the team to have accomplished what they have done.</p><p>Our primary focus this year was business continuity. I would like to amplify the comments on Page 4 of the deck that follows. We ensured that the SunEdison bankruptcy did not materially impact the effective operation of our fleet. The fleet continues to perform well. We spent a lot of time and effort to make certain the working relationships with our many partners is not disrupted. Importantly, we also are very focused on employee retention and had very little attrition with executives or employees.</p>", "company": "TerraForm Power, Inc.", "exec": [["Brett Prior", "IR", "TerraForm Power, Inc."], ["Peter Blackmore", "Chairman and Interim CEO", "TerraForm Power, Inc."], ["Rebecca Cranna", "EVP and CFO", "TerraForm Power, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Julien Dumoulin-Smith", "UBS"], ["Noah Kaye", "Oppenheimer & Co."], ["Vishal B.

Welcome to our earnings conference call for our fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, 2016. </p><p>After the market closed yesterday we issued a press release reporting our results for the fiscal fourth quarter. This release is available on our website www.intlfcstone.com, as well as a slide presentation which we will refer to on this call in our discussions of our quarterly and year-to-date results. You'll need to sign on to the live webcast in order to view the presentation. But the presentation and an archive of the webcast will also be available on our website after the call's conclusion. </p><p>Before getting underway, we're required to advise you and all participants should note that the following discussion should be taken in conjunction with the most recent financial statements and notes thereto, as well as the Form 10-K filed with the SEC. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which are detailed on our filings with the SEC. </p><p>Although the Company believes that its forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding its business and future market conditions, there can be no assurances that the Company's actual results will not differ materially from any results expressed or implied by the Company's forward-looking statements.

Good morning, everyone and welcome to our FY '16 fourth quarter earnings call. The general market environment has changed for us in ways that were unforeseen and unanticipated, starting with the unexpected Brexit vote, followed by the surprise U.S. presidential vote, has led to possibly more favorable conditions for our business. It would seem that in the U.S. anyway, markets have become more optimistic and interest rates reacted accordingly which over time should have a material and direct impact on our earnings. In addition, the withdrawal of the Fed from the markets, combined with the less predictable political playing field, should increase overall volatility which is also a favorable development for us. </p><p>Finally, higher commodity prices are also a welcome development. So overall, although not evident throughout the Q4 under review here, market conditions would seem to have improved for our business overall. Just as in 2015, Q4 was again the best quarter of the year for us. We achieved earnings of $16.8 million which was down 20% against last year's record result and EPS of $0.90 per diluted share, down 17%. The EPS was down relatively less than earnings due to the impact of share buybacks in the early part of the fiscal year. </p><p>Just as in 2015, our Q4 results had some unusual nonoperating items. This year we recorded a $6.2 million nontaxable gain on the acquisition of the Sterne Agee business as a result of us having acquired the businesses at an effective discount to the asset value received. </p>", "company": "INTL FCStone, Inc.", "exec": [["Sean O'Connor", "CEO ", "INTL FCStone, Inc."], ["Bill Dunaway", "CFO", "INTL FCStone, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Greg Eisen", "Singular Research"], ["Christopher Hillary", "Roubaix Capital"]], "date": "December 15, 2016, 09:00 ET", "ticker": "INTL", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Hosting the call today are Dr. John Coustas, Chief Executive Officer of Danaos Corporation; and Mr. Evangelos Chatzis, Chief Financial Officer of Danaos Corporation. Mr. Coustas and Mr. Chatzis will be making some introductory comments and then we will open the call to a question-and-answer session.</p><p>At this time would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chatzis, Chief Financial Officer. </p><h1>Evangelos Chatzis</h1><p>Thank you operator. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin I quickly want to remind everyone that management remarks this morning may contain certain forward looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projected today. These forward looking statements are made as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them. Factors that might affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC and we encourage you to review these detailed safe harbor and risk factor disclosures. Please also note that where we feel appropriate we will continue to refer to non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to evaluate our business. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and the accompanying materials.</p><p>Now let me turn the call over to Dr. Coustas who will provide the broad overview of the quarter. </p><h1>John Coustas</h1><p>Thank you, Evangelos. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call to discuss our results for third quarter 2016. We reported our results for third quarter 2016 in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of Hanjin Shipping, one of Danaos large customers. As a result of the bankruptcy, we did not recognize any operating revenues for the vessels that had been charted to Hanjin during the quarter. This reduced our operating net revenues by 24.8 million and was the main contributor to the 21 million reduction in our adjusted net income to 22.8 million compared to an adjusted net income of 43.8 million the third quarter of 2015. Setting aside the significant effect of the Hanjin bankruptcy on our operating revenues and our bottom line, we have otherwise managed to improve our adjusted net income by 3.8 million, mainly due to 10.2 million improvement in net financing course resulting from continued deleveraging of balance sheet, interest rate swap expiration and 1.3 million reduction in total operating expenses which was partially offset by 8 million reduction in operating revenues attributed to lower fleet utilization, the sale of the Federal during first quarter and lower re-chartering rate for certain of our vessels in a softer charter market.</p><p>As a result of the Hanjin bankruptcy, we also recorded the write-off of 15.8 million representing the outstanding charter hire owed to us by Hanjin as of June 30, 2016. Additionally, principally as a result of the effect of the cancellation of the Hanjin charters, the company was in breach of certain financial covenants of September 30, 2016 for which we've obtained waivers until April 1, 2017. Because the waivers offer a period of 11, 12 months, all the debt has been classified as current on September 30. Notwithstanding the negative consequence of the Hanjin bankruptcy, the company is currently in a position to fully service all operational and contractual financial obligations. All the Hanjin vessels have been discharged and redelivered to us. And we have already re-chartered five 3,400 TEU vessels at market rates while we're still in negotiations to charter the remaining three 10,100 TEU vessels which we expect to be deployed after the end of the first quarter of 2017.</p>", "company": "Danaos Corporation", "exec": [["John Coustas", "CEO", "Danaos Corporation"], ["Evangelos Chatzis", "CFO", "Danaos Corporation"]], "analysts": [["Mark Suarez", "McQuilling Holdings"]], "date": "December 16, 2016 09:00 AM ET", "ticker": "DAC", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

I'll start with the income statement and finish by providing comments on our balance sheet, leverage and cash flow. Consolidated net sales during the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year of 2016 increased 27% and 44% to $249 million and $928 million respectively compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. As expected the increases were driven by contributions from the HL Plastics and Woodcraft acquisitions. We reported income from continuing operations of $5.4 million and a loss from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the three months and twelve months ended October 31, 2016 respectively compared to income from continuing operations of $9.9 million and $15.6 million for the comparable period in 2015. </p><p>Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $15.6 million or $0.45 per share during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $13.4 million or $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full-year 2016 adjusted net income from continuing operations was $27.7 million or $0.80 per share compared to $23.7 million or $0.69 per share for the full-year 2015. The adjustments being made for EPS are as follows; acquisition related transaction costs and purchase price inventory step-up recognition, the write-off of deferred loan costs, unamortized original issuance discount and prepayment call premium related to our debt refinancing in July, foreign currency losses primarily related to an inner company note with HL Plastics, restructuring charges and the goodwill impairment charge. As disclosed in the earnings release, we recorded restructuring charges of $529,000 in Q4 related to the closings of two US vinyl extrusion facilities and the cabinet components facility in Mexico.</p><p>We will have more expense in 2017 as a result of these closures for equipment relocation, lease runoff and accelerated depreciation and amortization. Related to shedding business with a large US vinyl profile customer and closing the two facilities, we recorded a $12.6 million goodwill impairment charge and recognized $1.3 million of accelerated depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2016. After taking this impairment charge, there is no more goodwill remaining on the books for our US vinyl profiles business. On a consolidated basis, EBITDA was $21.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $27.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full-year 2016 EBITDA was $89.5 million compared to $59.9 million for the full-year 2015. After adjustments related to transaction costs inventory step up, restructuring charges and the goodwill impairment, adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% to $34.6 million during the quarter compared to $30.4 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the full-year 2016, adjusted EBITDA increased by 58% to $110.3 million compared to $68.7 million in 2015.</p>", "company": "Quanex Building Products Corporation", "exec": [["Scott Zuehlke", "VP of IR and Treasurer", "Quanex Building Products Corporation"], ["Bill Griffiths", "Chairman, President and CEO", "Quanex Building Products Corporation"], ["Brent Korb", "SVP of Finance and CFO", "Quanex Building Products Corporation"]], "analysts": [["Daniel Moore", "CJS Securities"], ["Al Kaschalk", "Wedbush Securities"], ["Steven Ramsey", "Thompson Research Group"], ["Ken Zener", "KeyBanc"]], "date": "December 16, 2016 11:00 AM ET", "ticker": "NX", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

Approximately two-thirds of all school buses are purchased and operated directly by some 10,000 school districts with about 3,400 independent contractors purchasing and operating the remaining one-third of buses on the road today. Bottom line, it\u2019s a robust and institutionalized transportation system and it\u2019s a well-supported industry.</p><p>So, let\u2019s see how the new school bus industry fared in fiscal 2016. Let\u2019s turn to slide five.</p><p>At 32,700 buses, new vehicle registrations for full year fiscal 2016 were the highest since 2007. This was an increase of 9% over fiscal 2015. Clearly, this is a strong increase, but it should be noted that vehicle registrations can lag booked OEM sales to dealers and national fleets by several weeks or even months. We estimate that the fiscal 2016 industry, as measured by [indiscernible] registrations, benefited by between a 1,000 to 1,500 units from the surge deliveries for school start in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.</p><p>In other words, the OEM sale was recognized in fiscal 2015, but the vehicle registration by the end customers recognized in fiscal 2016. So, the underlying real industry growth was probably between 5% to 6% in fiscal 2016. Nevertheless, the new bus industry exhibited another solid year of growth. In particular, vehicle registrations with the dealer network were very strong with 12% growth across the entire industry. Importantly, at Blue Bird, we saw 18% growth in registrations for sales through our dealer network. As you\u2019ll see later, this translates into higher Blue Bird market share.</p>", "company": "Blue Bird Corporation", "exec": [["Mark Benfield", "Director, IR", "Blue Bird Corporation"], ["Phil Horlock", "President and CEO", "Blue Bird Corporation"], ["Phil Tighe", "CFO", "Blue Bird Corporation"]], "analysts": [["Eric Stine", "Craig-Hallum"], ["Mike Baudendistel", "Stifel"], ["Scott Blumenthal", "Emerald Advisers"], ["Chris Moore", "CJS"], ["Peter van Roden", "Spitfire Capital"]], "date": "December 13, 2016 08:00 AM ET", "ticker": "BLBD", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

{"entry": {"title": "Q3 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call", "transcript": "<p>Good day, and welcome to the North West Company's Third Quarter Results.</p><p>I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Edward Kennedy, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Kennedy, please go ahead.</p><h1>Edward Kennedy</h1><p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm Edward Kennedy, President and CEO of North West Company. Joining me today are Paulina Hiebert, our VP, Legal and Secretary and John King, our EVP and CFO. Before I start my remarks and open for questions, I will ask Paulina to read our disclaimer statement.</p><h1>Paulina Hiebert</h1><p>Thank you, Edward.</p><p>Before we begin, I'll remind you that certain information presented today may constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect North West's current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and are subject to certain risks which could cause actual performance and financial results in the future to vary materially from those contemplated in the forward-looking statements. For additional information on these risks, please see North West's annual information form, and its MD&A under the heading risk factors.</p><h1>Edward Kennedy</h1><p>Thanks Paulina.</p><p>So before I get into the operating results for the quarter, I'm going to just comment on the accounting aspect of our quarter specific to stock based and variable comp tied to performance. So we saw a swing the other way when the stock price was higher, the stock price went down in the quarter and the mark-to-market on our stock based comp is a credit against the charge last year.</p><p>We also are in a scenario where we pay our short term incentive pay, we have a pretty firm threshold of pay, no pay and if we trend out our performance right now this year we're close to no pay zone and that is of course an adjustment on our short term incentive pay. So those two adjustments come back into the P&L and it's a credit.</p><p>And when you separate all that, I think it's in Note 9 to the financial statements, it's a tough quarter because you take out last year and this year's and you weigh it all out and we're down maybe $1 million, $1.2 million in EBITDA.</p><p>So that is what I want to talk about. I mean I will say that the way we're set up in terms of that risk of variable pay, as kind of a natural shock absorber in the way our earnings will level out over time over any given year in fact and we're set up that way because we want to have consistent cash flow. If we don\u2019t hit our targets, that all comes back to the company and it helps protect on the downside both for dividend and just general cash flow.</p><p>So this is one of those years, it could get better in Q4 but our best outlook is that it is that kind of year when the incentive pace is going to be in the low end and it is going to come back as a credit for the benefit of our shareholders.</p><p>So now on the operating side, the quarter had some things that we knew were going to be tougher specific to Alaska. I think most of our investors were aware that we were facing permanent fund dividend cut that was 50% and when you think about North West, a lot of our core customers depend on government transfer payments, they are typically not that volatile but the permanent fund is a transfer payment that has volatility attached and when it's cut by that degree, the discretionary spending really dries up and we noticed that in our market.</p>", "company": "North West Company, Inc.", "exec": [["Edward Kennedy", "President and CEO", "North West Company, Inc."], ["Paulina Hiebert", "VP, Legal and Corporate Secretary", "North West Company, Inc."], ["John King", "EVP and CFO", "North West Company, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Michael Van Aelst", "TD Securities"], ["Tal Woolley", "Dundee Capital Partners"], ["Sabahat Khan", "RBC Capital Markets"], ["Stephen MacLeod", "BMO Capital Markets"], ["Neil Linsdell", "Industrial Alliance"], ["Jim Durran", "Barclays"], ["Matt Bank", "CIBC"], ["Keith Howlett", "Desjardins Securities"]], "date": "December 13, 2016, 02:00 PM ET", "ticker": "NWTUF", "exchange": "OTC"}},

Rick\u2019s Cabaret New York is at the 50 West 33rd Street, that\u2019s between Fifth Avenue and Broadway, around the corner from the Empire State Building. If you haven\u2019t RSVP-ed, ask for me at the door.</p><p>Now, I am pleased to introduce Eric Langan, President and CEO of RCI Hospitality.</p><h1>Eric Langan</h1><p>Thank you and thanks for joining us today. Good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 4. After the market closed, we announced fourth quarter and year end results. On a GAAP basis for the quarter, we earned $0.04 per share. For the year, we earned $1.10 compared to $0.90 last year. Keep in mind, that these results include a number of fourth quarter net charges, most of which are related to the expansion of our capital allocation strategy as we had announced in October.</p><p>Adjusting our results for these and other items, on a non-GAAP basis, we experienced a strong fourth quarter performance. EPS came in at $0.31 per share, approximately 47% higher than the $0.21 we did last year. For the year, we earned $1.32 per share compared to $1.35 last year. This reflects lower comparisons in the first half of fiscal year 2016 and a rebound in the second half. Even more important, we exceeded our free cash flow target for the year, generating $3.8 million in the fourth quarter and $20.5 million for the year. As a result, of the first full year implementation of our capital allocation strategy, we ended fiscal 2016 in great shape. We are on track for improved revenues, margins and profits in fiscal 2017, as well as baseline free cash flow run rate of $18 million. In addition, we continue to apply our capital allocation strategy as evidenced by ongoing share buybacks in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.</p><p>If you please turn to Slide 5. Our focus at RCI is growing free cash flow per share, thus, our capitalization is critical. For those of you new to RCI, I would like to take a minute to review the capital allocation strategy we put in place a year ago. We have updated this slide for our lower share count due to buybacks and the pay-down of convertible debt. We have two major uses of our free cash flow. One is buying back shares. For example, at $14 where the stock price has traded recently, buying back shares generate an after-tax yield on free cash flow of 13%. We consider this yield risk-free since we are buying our own assets, which we know very well. Two is buying or opening new units. We target a 2x hurdle rate to account for the risk of making a new investment. Absent an otherwise strategic rationale, for example, at $14 per share, we would want a new unit to produce or return about 26% or greater, which translates into a cash on cash return in a little less than 4 years. Conversely, if a unit is not performing in line with our strategy and efforts to improve it have not been successful, we will take action to free up as much capital as possible for more profitable use as we announced in October. With regard to paying down debt only at a much higher stock price, does it make sense on a tax adjusted basis to pay down our most expensive debt at an accelerated rate assuming no prepayment penalty. Having said that, we are always looking for ways to refinance our higher interest debt at better rates as we did in August.</p>", "company": "RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.", "exec": [["Gary Fishman", "Investor Relations", "RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc."], ["Eric Langan", "President and Chief Executive Officer", "RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc."], ["Phillip Marshall", "Chief Financial Officer", "RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc."]], "analysts": [["Frank Camma", "Sidoti & Company"], ["Mike Mork", "Mork Capital Management"], ["Jeffrey Benton", "Fairfield Advisors"], ["Bill Brown", "Private Investor"], ["Evan Tindell", "Bireme Capital"]], "date": "December 13, 2016 16:30 ET", "ticker": "RICK", "exchange": "NYSE"}},

I\u2019m pleased to have the opportunity to share our exciting accomplishments from 2016, and give you a sense of some key milestones to look forward to for 2017. As a reminder, for those of you who do may be new to Anavex, we are clinical stage biotechnology company, our focus is on developing effective targeted therapies for the treatment of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases under the precision medicine paradigms.</p><p>A bit about the market, neurodegenerative users including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and Multiple Sclerosis, which represent major unmet medical needs globally. With respect to Alzheimer\u2019s there are just four drugs currently approved by the FDA. These drugs only temporarily slow the worsening of symptoms for six months, in roughly 50% of the patients. The economic burden of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is forecasted to reach approximately $1.5 trillion annually by 2050 as the population continues to age.</p><p>Neurodevelopmental diseases including Rett syndrome, infantile spasm, altruism [indiscernible] and epilepsy also represents significant unmet medical needs. Briefly to our technology, our lead compound is ANAVEX 2-73, an orally available small molecule activating the sigma-1 receptor.
