<heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates generally to optical spectroscopy and more particularly to devices operable to generate a focused optical beam spot and methods of fabrication thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">An ongoing challenge to understanding matter at the nanoscale is the difficulty in carrying out local optical spectroscopy. On a fundamental level, this should be possible by squeezing light beyond the diffraction limit. Optical-antenna-based geometries have been designed to address this nanospectroscopy imaging problem by transforming light from the far-field to the near-field, but unfortunately with serious limitations on sensitivity, bandwidth, resolution, and/or sample types.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A strategy that overcomes the limitations of optical-antenna-based geometries (e.g., sensitivity, bandwidth, resolution, and/or sample types), based on a unique geometry capable of efficiently coupling far-field light to the near-field and vice-versa without background illumination, and over a wide range of wavelengths, is described herein. In some embodiments, the geometry includes a campanile probe, a three-dimensional tapered structure terminating in a nanometer sized gap, with a shape resembling that of a &#x201c;campanile&#x201d; bell tower.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference will now be made in detail to some specific examples of the invention including the best modes contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention. Examples of these specific embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While the invention is described in conjunction with these specific embodiments, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the described embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. Particular example embodiments of the present invention may be implemented without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes be described in singular form for clarity. However, it should be noted that some embodiments include multiple iterations of a technique or multiple instantiations of a mechanism unless noted otherwise.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Various near-field probe geometries have been engineered with extraordinary optical transmission or with coupled optical antenna structures directly on the scan-probe apex, greatly improving coupling efficiencies. However, these generally rely on resonant structures with limited spectral bandwidth and have often used excitation modalities that are not background-free. Of note are recent approaches combining elements of apertureless near-field scanning microscopy (a-NSOM) tips with efficient photon-to-plasmon coupling structures that can be illuminated far from the sample. When designed correctly, these types of probes can be broadband since they exploit adiabatic plasmonic compression.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">There is, however, one drawback to these probes: maximum enhancement is only achieved in the tip-substrate gap mode. The tip-substrate gap mode can yield large near-field signals, but requires both a metallic substrate and a very small tip-substrate gap. Therefore, only very thin samples (e.g., molecular monolayers) can be studied.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments described herein can overcome all these problems, offering a different concept that unites broadband field enhancement and confinement with efficient bi-directional coupling between far-field and near-field electromagnetic energy, thereby enabling the translation of the wide spectrum of optical measurement modalities to the nanometer scale.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Device and Methods</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Embodiments of a campanile probe disclosed herein are based on a three-dimensional tapered metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure ending in a nanogap. Simulations have shown that this geometry can provide efficient coupling between far- and near-fields since the fundamental mode in an MIM structure is supported without any cut-off frequency, no matter how thin the insulating layer. In the optical regime, where plasmonic effects become important at small length scales, it has been shown that efficient delivery of far-field light to an ultra-small region is possible in two dimensions using a tapered planar MIM structure (&#x3e;70% conversion efficiency), and in three dimensions with a dimple lens structure. Equally important is the fact that the bi-directional coupling of the campanile probe is efficient over a large bandwidth, taking advantage of an adiabatically-tapered geometry utilized at longer wavelengths (e.g., the microwave and terahertz regimes) to provide a simple broadband method for effectively overcoming the diffraction limit. The bandwidth may be limited by metal absorption at short wavelengths, and can be extended well into the infrared region (and beyond). Other metals can be used to access the blue or ultraviolet (UV) regions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of an isometric illustration of a campanile probe. A campanile probe <b>100</b> comprises a transparent tip comprising a dielectric material <b>105</b>. An apex of the transparent tip includes a four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. Metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> are disposed over two opposing sides of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. An apex <b>120</b> of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure includes a gap between the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the dielectric material <b>105</b> of the transparent tip may comprise an optically transparent material; an optically transparent material is a material that allows light (e.g., visible light, infrared light, or ultraviolet light) to pass through the material without being scattered. In some embodiments, the dielectric material <b>105</b> of the transparent tip may comprise an optically transparent polymer, diamond, silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiO, SiO<sub>x</sub>, where x is a non-integer number), silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), indium tin oxide (ITO, a solid solution of indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>)), and hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> may comprise gold, silver, copper, or aluminum. In some embodiments, the metal layers may be about 25 nanometers (nm) to 75 nm thick, or about 50 nm thick. In some embodiments, the metal layer may be greater than about 75 nm thick. Such a campanile probe having metal layers may be used with visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the campanile probe <b>100</b> may include adhesion layers (now shown) disposed on the two opposing sides of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. The metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> are disposed on the adhesion layers. The adhesion layers may aid in adhering the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> to the dielectric material <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the adhesion layers may comprise a metal. For example, in some embodiments, the adhesion layers may comprise titanium or chromium. In some embodiments, the adhesion layers may be about 1 nm to 5 nm thick, or about 2 nm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the campanile probe <b>100</b> may include a dielectric layer (not shown) disposed on the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure, including the metal layers. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer comprises silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, or silicon nitride. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer may be about 2 nm to 5 nm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the dielectric layer may protect the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> from oxidation and from mechanical damage when the campanile probe <b>100</b> is in use. Such a dielectric layer also may aid in keeping the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> disposed on or over the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. For example, the metal layers of a campanile probe that does not include the dielectric layer may peel away from or flake off of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure when the campanile probe is in operation. Further, the dielectric layer may reduce or prevent atomic migration of the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> (e.g., due to thermal effects), which may also aid in keeping the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> disposed on or over the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer may prevent electrical contact between a sample being studied and the campanile probe.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, a substantially square or a rectangular base <b>125</b> of the dielectric material <b>105</b> comprising the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure may have dimensions of about 50 nm to 20 microns by about 50 nm to 20 microns, about 50 nm to 5 microns by about 50 nm to 5 microns, or about 100 nm to 200 nm by about 100 nm to 200 nm. In some embodiments, at least one dimension of the substantially square or a rectangular base <b>125</b> (i.e., a length or a width) may have a dimension that is that is larger than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation to be used with the campanile probe <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the substantially square or a rectangular base <b>125</b> may have a height of about 1 nm to 5 microns or about 1 nm to 1 micron. In some embodiments, the substantially square or a rectangular base <b>125</b> may have a specific height to aid in the fabrication process. In some embodiments, the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure may have a square or a rectangular base, but the base may have no height or a height of zero.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, an angle <b>130</b> at which a side of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure slopes compared to a vertical axis of the campanile probe <b>100</b> may be about 15 degrees to 45 degrees, about 20 degrees to 40 degrees, or about 30 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b> show examples of cross-sectional schematic illustrations of the apex of a four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure of a campanile probe. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the apex <b>120</b> of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure includes a gap between the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the gap may be about 1 nm to 100 nm wide, about 2 nm to 50 nm wide, or less about 10 nm wide, between the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the gap may define a substantially flat surface of the dielectric material <b>105</b> of the transparent tip, and separate the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> by about 1 nm to 100 nm or about 2 nm to 50 nm. In some embodiments, a length of the gap (i.e., into the paper of the cross sectional schematic illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) may be about 1 nm to 15 nm, about 15 nm to 45 nm, or about 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure may include a substantially flat surface comprising the dielectric material <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, the edges of the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> may be tapered, as shown by the dashed lines at that apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, some or all of the dielectric material may be removed from the gap between the two metal layers. An example of such an apex of a four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The apex <b>300</b> of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a gap between the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the gap may be about 1 nm to 100 nm wide, about 2 nm to 50 nm wide, or less than about 10 nm wide, between the metal layers <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>. The gap also may have a depth of about 25 nm to 75 nm; i.e., the gap may define an open region that does not include any material (i.e., the dielectric material or the metal layers). In some embodiments, a length of the gap (i.e., into the paper of the cross sectional schematic illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) may be about 1 nm to 15 nm, about 15 nm to 45 nm, or about 30 nm. In some embodiments, an open gap as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may push the near field spot generated by a campanile probe from the apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure, which may enable the campanile probe to couple with a sample being studied more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A campanile probe including metal layers is operable with visible light. In some embodiments, instead of the four-sided pyramidal structure of the transparent tip having metal layers disposed over two opposing sides of the four-sided pyramidal structure, doped semiconductor layers or layers of other ceramic materials are disposed over two opposing sides of the four-sided pyramidal structure. Such a campanile probe including doped semiconductor layers or layers of other ceramic materials may be operable with infrared light. In some embodiments, the doped semiconductor layers may include conductive oxide layers or doped metal oxide layers. For example, in some embodiments, the doped metal oxide layers include layers of doped-titanium oxide, doped-zirconium oxide, doped-zinc oxide, and tin-doped indium oxide (ITO). In some embodiments, the layers of ceramic material may include titanium nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Using nanofabrication techniques, the campanile probe <b>100</b> can be incorporated into many different transparent tips associated with scanning probe tips, including atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers and optical fibers such as those used in conventional aperture-based NSOM.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show examples of scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs of a campanile probe. As shown in the SEM micrograph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a campanile probe <b>400</b> includes a four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure <b>405</b> with a square or rectangular base <b>410</b>. The dimension bar shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> indicates that the thickness or width of the base of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure of the campanile probe <b>400</b> is 1.07 microns.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in the SEM micrograph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an apex <b>500</b> of a campanile probe includes a first metal layer <b>505</b>, a second metal layer <b>510</b>, and a dielectric material <b>515</b>; white dotted lines are included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to more clearly define the dielectric material and the metal layers. A gap <b>520</b> is defined between the first metal layer <b>505</b> and the second metal layer <b>510</b>. The gap <b>520</b> does not include any of the first or second metal layers <b>505</b> and <b>510</b>, and the dielectric material <b>515</b> has been removed from the gap. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the dimension bar indicates that the width of the gap at the apex of the campanile probe is 39 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) probe may include a tapered cylindrical coaxial structure at an apex of a transparent tip, instead of a four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure as in a campanile probe. Light from a tapered cylindrical coaxial structure may be of a different polarization compared to light from a campanile probe including a four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. Further, a MIM probe including a tapered cylindrical coaxial structure may have a sharper apex or end than the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure of a campanile probe, which may improve the topographical mapping capabilities of a MIM probe.</p>

When the metal layers are in electrical contact or there is not a well-defined gap at the apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure, a gap between the metal layer may be formed with an additional operation at block <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, at block <b>720</b> of the process <b>700</b>, a gap is formed between the metal layers at an apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure.

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the gap may be formed using a focused ion beam. In some embodiments, the focused ion beam may use gallium ions or argon ions. In some embodiments, the focused ion beam may use helium ions, which may improve the resolution of the focused ion beam compared to other ions.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, forming the gap may include forming a gap between the metal layers and removing the dielectric material of the transparent tip between the metal layers, resulting in a gap as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In some embodiments, forming the gap may include directing a focused ion beam along the z-direction of a campanile probe (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In some embodiments, the gap may be about 1 nm to 100 nm wide, about 2 nm to 50 nm wide, or less than about 10 nm wide, between the two metal layers, and about 25 nm to 75 nm deep; i.e., the gap may define an open region not including any material (i.e., the dielectric material or the metal layers). In some embodiments, a length of the gap (i.e., into the paper of the cross sectional schematic illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) may be about 1 nm to 15 nm, about 15 nm to 45 nm, or about 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, forming the gap may include forming a gap between the metal layers, with the dielectric material of the transparent tip remaining between the metal layers, resulting in a gap as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In some embodiments, forming the gap may include an ion milling process in which x-y planes (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of material are removed from the apex of a four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. In some embodiments, the gap may be about 1 nm to 100 nm wide, about 2 nm to 50 nm wide, or less than about 10 nm wide, between the two meal layers. In some embodiments, the gap may define a substantially flat surface of the dielectric material of the transparent tip, and separate the metal layers by about 1 nm to 100 nm, about 2 nm to 50 nm, or by less than about 10 nm. In some embodiments, a length of the gap (i.e., into the paper of the cross sectional schematic illustration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) may be about 1 nm to 15 nm, about 15 nm to 45 nm, or about 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, forming the gap may include applying a current and a voltage to the two metal layers of a sufficient strength to melt any metal connection between the two metal layers at the apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. When the metal at the apex melts, the metal may form small spheres (i.e., due to surface tension), and this may sever the electrical contact between the two metal layers.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, forming the gap may include inducing mechanical stresses at the apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure that cause the end of the apex to break off or fracture. For example, due to thermal expansion mismatches between the transparent tip and the metal layers, mechanical stresses may be induced in the in the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure by heating it up and then cooling it down. As another example, when the material of the transparent tip is a piezoelectric material, a voltage may be applied across the transparent tip which may induce mechanical stresses.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments of the process <b>700</b>, before block <b>715</b>, adhesion layers may be deposited on the two opposing sides of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure. The metal layers may be deposited on the adhesion layers at block <b>715</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments of the process <b>700</b>, before block <b>715</b>, surfaces of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure may be functionalized with thiol groups (e.g., sulfhydryl groups).

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the process <b>700</b> may further include depositing a dielectric layer over the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure after block <b>715</b> or block <b>720</b>. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer may be deposited on the entire four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure, including the metal layers. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer may be deposited with an ALD process or a chemical vapor deposition process. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer comprises silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, or silicon nitride. In some embodiments, the dielectric layer may be about 2 nm to 5 nm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, a process similar to the process <b>700</b> may be performed, but instead of depositing metal layers at block <b>715</b>, doped semiconductor layers may be deposited.

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The following example of experiments performed with a campanile probe as disclosed herein is intended to be an example of methods of use of the embodiments disclosed herein, and is not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To demonstrate the utility of campanile probes, campanile probes with about 40 nm wide gaps were used to map out the inhomogeneous radiative recombination in individual indium phosphide (InP) nanowires (NWs), chosen because of their photoluminescence emission properties and their potential as a nanomaterial for light harvesting due to the 1.4 eV band gap and assumed low surface recombination rates. Trap states are believed to be responsible for many optical phenomena in nanocrystals and wires, including surface-state-mediated luminescence modification in InP NWs, but are not well-understood due to optical resolution limitations. Gaining this insight requires both local optical excitation and local luminescence collection.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A glass fiber with a campanile probe was mounted in a shear-force scanner and coupled to a 633 nm laser. The near-field spot was scanned over the sample to locally excite and collect the photoluminescence from the InP NWs. Because of the broadband enhancement, only 100 &#x3bc;W of pre-fiber-coupled laser excitation power was needed to collect and disperse a full emission spectrum with a high resolution grating between 760 nm and 900 nm. With a 100 ms integration time, a signal-to-noise ratio &#x3e;60/1 was achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Topography and a full spectrum were recorded at each image pixel, and photoluminescence maps were built by taking slices from the hyperspectral data. The confocal excitation power used for a far-field confocal microscope was equivalent to that used for the campanile probe to achieve a comparable signal to noise ratio. The campanile probe provided resolution approximately equal to the gap size and much higher than the confocal resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">It has previously been observed that strong photoluminescence enhancements and photoluminescence blue shifts result from passivated InP NW surfaces. This was attributed to Coulombic interactions between excitons and positively-charged trap states on the NW surfaces. These studies substantiated the hypothesis that trap states influence the optoelectronic properties of nanocrystals and nanowires much more strongly than commonly assumed. The exciton diffusion length in these materials is hundreds of nanometers, and therefore individual trap states within the diffusion volume should strongly influence the local absorption energy and charge recombination rate. However, this has not been directly observed due to the lack of resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It is believed that the observed heterogeneity along the wires on length scales well below the exciton diffusion length are direct maps of trap-state modifications of the local exciton properties. The observed photoluminescence intensity hot spots are likely due to an increase of trap state densities (and changes in the native oxide layer) at the wire ends resulting from the NW broken-end morphology. Their spectral characteristics are consistent with a trap-induced Stark shift, predicted to be &#x2dc;60 meV to 70 meV above the band edge for positive trap states, in accordance with these experiments. Additionally, local trap states are known to cause Fermi level pinning and local band bending in some cases, which would also affect local recombination rates. In contrast, the absence of spectral variations in confocal measurements can be attributed to (a) the lack of spatial resolution and (b) the far-field photoluminescence measurement probing the entire NW thickness; i.e., surface-specific effects are obscured by bulk behavior. Catholuminesence measurements on InP NWs achieve a comparable resolution and provide complementary information. However, the large number of incident electrons fill the trap states and do not detect any spatial variation in emission from InP NWs.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It should be noted that the increased density of optical states at the tip apex (i.e., the apex of the four-sided pyramidal-shaped structure) will change the balance between various recombination pathways and may enable otherwise dark states to radiatively recombine. It should also be noted that measurements on NWs, and any sample thicker than about 2 nm, are not possible with a-NSOM in tip-substrate gap mode, and therefore all other near-field/tip-enhanced techniques previously demonstrated lack the signal strength and sensitivity shown here, which is critical for investigating the majority of samples.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Campanile probe far- to near-field transformers provide a pathway for understanding energy conversion processes at their critical length scales, which, for example, yielded new insights into the role of local trap states on radiative charge recombination in InP NWs. More generally, this example demonstrates the potential impact of the campanile probe geometry on a wide range of nano-optical measurements, since virtually all possible categories of optical imaging and spectroscopy can now be brought to the nanoscale, including Raman and IR/FTIR hyperspectral imaging, as well as white-light nanoellipsometry/interferometric mapping of dielectric functions. Additionally, it is expected that the combination of large bandwidth and enhancement will make campanile probes useful for ultrafast, pump-probe and/or nonlinear experiments down to molecular length scales, where they would be used for ultrasensitive medical detection, (photo)catalysis and quantum-optics investigations, as plasmonic optomechanics and circuitry elements, and as the cornerstone of tabletop high-harmonic/X-ray and photoemission sources.</p>
